# Serverless Web Application on AWS

## Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

### Project Description:

Developed a serverless web application enabling users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on items stored in a DynamoDB table. Utilized AWS Lambda for backend processing to handle all CRUD operations, ensuring a scalable and serverless architecture. Stored and retrieved static assets from Amazon S3, integrating it with the application for efficient data storage and management.Leveraged AWS DynamoDB for fast, flexible NoSQL database services, handling data persistence and optimizing query performance.Focused on cost-efficient cloud solutions, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resilience for the application.

### Steps to Build the Project:

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \
